**Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NasrSyed/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Architected a routine monitoring agent script which tracked a cluster of nodes/servers running on CentOS 7 Linux distribution. Bash scripts retrieving host hardware, CPU and Memory usage were deployed, and provisioned via Docker. Results were periodically stored into a PostgreSQL database via crontab job.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NasrSyed/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Grep App: Implemented a Java application that takes in parameters for a regex pattern and returns matching lines containing this pattern from all text files in the target directory to an output text file. 
  - JDBC App: Architected a Java application that connects to a PSQL database containerized in Docker to perform basic CRUD operations between an object and respective database.
  - Twitter App: Curabitur laoreet tristique leo, eget suscipit nisi. Sed in sodales ex. Maecenas vitae tincidunt dui, et eleifend quam.
